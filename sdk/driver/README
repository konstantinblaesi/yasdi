This directory contains all YASDI bus drivers (as modules) which are 
currently available. Most drivers are platform specific. These drivers
are plugins, compiled as library (DLL, SO,...) and loaded during YASDI starts.
Of course it's also possible to "embedd" these driver into an static compiled
YASDI...
